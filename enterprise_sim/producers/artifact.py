"""Shared value types every producer speaks (ARCHITECTURE.md §5, §11.3-11.4).

A producer is a *pure function of* ``(Event, WorldView)`` that emits one or more
concrete files plus the knowledge-graph facts those files express. This module
holds the small, immutable contracts that result is made of — kept format-free so
the ``word``/``pptx``/``jira`` producers of later milestones reuse them unchanged:

* :class:`Locator` — *where* in a rendered artifact a span lives. Per-medium
  (markdown → char offset/length/line); the schema is uniform so a consumer
  handles one shape (§11.3).
* :class:`Mention` — an entity surface form occurring in artifact text (the
  ``kg/mentions.jsonl`` row, §11.4): entity-recognition + coreference ground truth.
* :class:`ValidationIssue` — a soft consistency finding (``validation/issues.jsonl``,
  D17) — e.g. an unresolved name the grounding repair pass could not fix.
* :class:`ProducedArtifact` — the producer's return value: the rendered body, the
  ``Artifact`` :class:`~enterprise_sim.core.world.Node`, the relationship
  :class:`~enterprise_sim.core.world.Edge`\\ s it expresses (``authored`` /
  ``reviewed`` / ``expresses`` / ``references``), its mentions, and any issues.

The producer *returns* these rather than mutating a graph so the orchestration
layer decides when to apply them; :func:`apply_to_world` is the one-liner that
does so, and :func:`provenance_records` / :func:`mention_records` /
:func:`issue_records` serialize the §11.4 side files.
